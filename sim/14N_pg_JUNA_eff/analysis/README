get HPGe efficiency curve by simulation

* filename.txt --> the simulation data of single gamma-ray from 1500 keV to 12500 keV;
* area.cpp     --> get area from simulation data file, write area_energy.txt/area3_energy.txt 4 coulomn including energy & area counts & total counts & total emmission, and the same with the area.cpp file in 14N_Ti/branch_ratio directory; 
* fit.cpp      --> fit full-energy efficiency curve, fit full-energy/total efficiency curve, get efficiency of gamma-ray considering summing effect or not, write the result file y1y2.txt with 3 coulomn include gamma-ray energy & efficiency do not considering summing effect & efficiency considering summing effect;
